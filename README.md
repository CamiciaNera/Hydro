# Hydro Anticheat

Hydro is an anticheat with a 3.001 reach check and some bare-bones checks. Good starter base that is organized good for someone looking to create their own anticheat or simply learn. We do not have time or any reason to finish this, if there is interest in doing so we will continue. This is another unfinished product that people will skid from. Enjoy this as not much open source work comes from the anticheat community.
