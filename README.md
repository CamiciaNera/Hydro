# Hydro Anticheat

Don't have time or reason to finish it, so here is another unfinished product that people will skid from. Enjoy this as not much open source work comes from the Anticheat community. Obviously, most Bad-Packet checks are from other anti-cheats since there was no point in trying to reinvent the wheel.
